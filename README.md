## Dashboard APP

Shiny app for economic conjuncture of Brazil and State of Espírito Santo

## What is it about?

This dashboard is a short and public version of the private dashboard,
used in the company. As the company’s dashboard data is confidential
(product information, results, defaults, customer profiles, etc.) the
idea of this public version is to be able to share it and get insights
into design and performance.

## How do i test it?

First you need to download `app.R`. Then you could either download
`series.R` and execute it to get a up-to-date download of the
time-series directly from Central Bank of Brazil (BCB), which will take
a few minutes, or you could download `series.RData` which contains all
the data i’ve uploaded last (faster for testing).

ps.: all files must be in the same directory.
